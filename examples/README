A short tutorial:

The file Separate.phs contains a simple polytypic program including
commments. To translate it to Haskell run

  polyp Separate.phs  | cat typeSeparate.hs - > Separate.hs

This will (if everything works out) write the translated PolyP program
to the file Separate.hs.

Look at the output file Separate.hs for some information about the
different phases of the translation.

To interpret this file, you can start hugs and tell hugs to load the
generated file Separate.hs by typing

  hugs Separate.hs

Now you can evaluate the main value by simply writing

  main

You can evaluate other functions in Separate.hs or check their types.

  separate_f4Rose (f 'P' [f 'a' [l 't',l 'r'],l 'i',l 'k']) where f = Fork; l c = f c []

  :type main

When done, exit hugs by typing

  :quit

There are a number of other small polytypic programs in this
directory, and the Makefile has some more information about these.
To run a test suite do
  make check
