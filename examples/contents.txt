This directory contains examples of the use of polytypic functions 
with PolyP. The translated files are interpreted by hugs (1.4).
All the examples are of the form 
  concatenate testM.phs its dependents using the perl script chase
  use polyp to translate the concatenated files to Haskell (testM.hs)
  run hugs on testM.hs
  evaluate main
  check that the value from main is correct
  quit hugs

make check will run all the examples and check that the output is correct.

A function stub for polytypic definitions is in `stub.phs'.
