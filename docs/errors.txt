Common error messages from polyp and possible causes:

Fail: codeFunctor: uninstantiated functor variable k
 found as part of FunctorOf k

  The type inference could not determine the actual datatype k that
  was to be used at a certain point. Thus no instance could be
  generated.

  Either a polytypic definition (the one currently being instantiated)
  is wrong, or it is used polytypically at the top level. For example:

  main = out
