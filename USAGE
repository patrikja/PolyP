----------------USAGE----------------

Basically the command polyp generates Haskell code from PolyP input.

More specifically: If you enter 

  polyp file.phs > file.hs

(the suffixes are just suggestions) you will get the generated code in
file.hs . This file is (hopefully) a valid Hugs program. It should
also be a Haskell program if main has type IO ().

The file.hs can be read by hugs (a Haskell interpreter)

  hugs file.hs
  main

Or it can be compiled with hbc (the Chalmers University Haskell
compiler) or with your favourite Haskell implementation (possibly
requiring some small changes to file.hs).

For examples see examples/README.

If something goes wrong in the code generation process, the
information in the starting comment in file.hs can be used to locate
the error. Every phase of Polyp will print information about its
progress, so by checking how far PolyP got you can get a pretty good
indication of where the error is. 

More usage information can be found in the docs/ directory.
