<h1>Known bugs in PolyP</h1>

<h2></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Context simplification errors: 
      <ul>
	<li>Problem: currently the context simplification algorithm
            simply removes all contexts without type variables. This
            can err in two ways: firstly ill-typed programs can be
            accepted (too much simplification, for example removing a
            bad context like Monad Tree => ) and secondly well-typed
            programs can be rejected (by hugs) (too little
            simplification, for example Monad (State s) is not
            simplified away.)

	<li>Solution: improve the context simplification
            algorithm. Extend PolyP to handle class and instance
            declarations so that the simlification rules can be given
            in the prelude file(s).

	<li>Almost solution: Add a PolyP-flag to allow explicit types
            not to be generated. (The types are there to get around
            the monomorphism restriction, and it usually bites at the
            same time as this bug, so the gain might be small.)

	<li>Work-around: Make unwanted contexts variable-free by
            inserting an explicit type somewhere.
	    
      </ul>
