PolyP - a polytypic programming language

    Patrik Jansson & Johan Jeuring

This distribution contains 
  * the source files for a compiler written in Haskell that compiles
    PolyP-code to Haskell.
  * a library of polytypic functions written in PolyP

PolyP can be compiled with 
  hbc - the Chalmers Haskell compiler.
    (hbc version 0.9999.3 or later 
     http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~augustss/hbc/hbc.html) 
  ghc - Glasgow Haskell
    (ghc-2.10 or later, http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/ghc/)
or interpreted by
  hugs - http://haskell.org/hugs/

For more information about PolyP, read the INSTALL, USAGE files or
the web-page at http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~patrikj/poly/polyp/
For information about polytypic programming in general check the web-pages
  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~patrikj/lic/
  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~johanj/polytypism/

(Most of the files are literate LaTeX scripts and the file book.tex can
be used to produce a commented program listing in a nice format.)
