polyp is compiled with 

 make X

where X is ghc, hbc or hugs depending on what you want to compile it
with. The compiled code runs faster with ghc, but the compilation
takes longer. 

This leaves the executable in the file bin/Xpolyp.

[The makefiles are written for GNU make, sometimes called gmake.]

To run a test suite do
  make check
