The polyp executable is built with 

 make [X] 

where X is ghc (deafault), hugs or hbc depending on what you want to
compile it with. The compiled code runs faster with ghc, but the
compilation takes longer. (The optional HASKELLVERSION=1.4 is for
compiling with pre-Haskell 98 compilers, like hbc 0.9999.4 and ghc
2.10.)

This leaves the executable in the file bin/Xpolyp and adds soft links
from INSTALLBINDIR to this exacutable.

[The makefiles are written for GNU make, sometimes called gmake.]

To run a test suite do
  make check
(If it prints nothing, everything is fine.)

Please send an email to

saying that you have installed PolyP so that we can give you
information about future changes to PolyP.
