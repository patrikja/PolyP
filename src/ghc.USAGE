[This is the file src/ghc.USAGE]

If the installation works out the executable should be in bin/ghcpolyp.

Rename this to polyp and put it on your path 
or link to it from your own bin directory
  ln -s bin/ghcpolyp $(HOME)/bin/polyp

The USAGE file gives more information (and assumes the executable is
called "polyp").
