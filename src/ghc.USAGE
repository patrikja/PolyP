[This is the file src/ghc.USAGE]

If the installation works out the executable should be in bin/ghcpolyp.

Rename this to polyp and put it on your path 
or link to it from your own bin directory (this is tcsh syntax)

  setenv POLYPDIR `pwd`
  ln -s $POLYPDIR/bin/ghcpolyp $HOME/bin/polyp

The USAGE file gives more information (and assumes the executable is
called "polyp").
